Data lake architecture is designed to store vast amounts of raw, unstructured, and structured data in its native format. It allows for the ingestion of diverse data sources without the need for upfront transformation. Data lakes typically leverage distributed file systems, such as Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and may employ technologies like Apache Spark or Apache Hive for data processing and analysis.
