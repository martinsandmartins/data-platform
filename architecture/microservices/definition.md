While not solely focused on data, microservices architecture is an approach where applications are built as a collection of small, loosely coupled services that can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled. Each microservice may have its own data storage and processing mechanisms, and communication between microservices is often facilitated through APIs. This architecture enables agility and scalability, especially in complex, distributed systems
