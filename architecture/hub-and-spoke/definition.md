Hub-and-spoke architecture combines elements of both traditional data warehousing and data lake approaches. It involves a central data hub (data warehouse) that serves as the core repository for structured and transformed data. Additionally, it includes spokes that represent specialized data marts or data lakes for specific business units or purposes. The hub acts as a central point for data integration, while spokes provide flexibility and agility for specific data needs.
